            <p class="description"><b>What is crypto?</b> Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money, based on blockchain technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="description"><b>What is "blockchain technology"?</b> A blockchain is a type of database. A blockchain collects information together in groups, also known as blocks, that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are chained onto the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the “blockchain.”</p>
            <br>
            <p class="description"><b>How does one obtain a cryptocurrency?</b> There are tons of crypto exchanges allowing you to buy and sell many different cryptocurrencies. It is quite more limited in the US, but you can always use a good VPN to access for instance, Binance.com, rather than the US version Binance.US. US exchanges are required to KYC (Know your customer, a term for requiring certain information such as a Drivers License or Passport) which can be very annoying. And US centralized exchanges have quite less of a selection to choose from.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="description"><b>Decentralized Exchanges</b> Unlike centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance.US, Uphold, and more), Dex's allow you to buy crypto anonymously, and work a little differently. Centralized Exchanges are exactly that, centralized. Decentralized Exchanges are peer to peer, meaning you are trading directly with someone else.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="description"><b>What crypto should I buy? And where?</b> Buying crypto can be hard, there are tons all trying to do the same thing. Bitcoin and Ethereum are always good routes, but always look out for promising new cryptocurrencies. Since we're talking about new currencies, they start out completely worthless, forget penny stocks.. How about cryptocurrencies priced at $ .00001 that just hit the exchange. Thats what happened to many people that held Dogecoin, as stupid as that sounds (is). It went from worthless to a cent, then suddenly to five cents, and so on. Dogecoin is a joke coin, and has an unlimited supply, please do not buy. It is always a good idea to DYOR (do your own research), if you need help, you can check out the DP Communities. Priced from $0 to $500, choose according to your ambition. Anyway, if you are in the US, your easiest options are centralized exchanges like; Coinbase, Kraken Pro, Binance.US, and more. But like I said earlier, there are Decentralized Exchanges, such as 1inch, Uniswap, Sushiswap, and more. I personally use Coinbase Pro, Kraken Pro, and Binance with a VPN.</p>
